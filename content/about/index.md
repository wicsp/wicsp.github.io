I'm a student who is interested in computer science and LLMs. I'm currently a PhD student at the Sun Yat-sen University in Shenzhen, China.

With the advancement of LLMs, documenting my problem-solving process has become quite straightforward. Thus, I've decided to revive my blog.

## Why Hugo?
Hugo is a static site generator that is very fast and efficient. It is also very easy to customize. And I discovered a fantastic theme called [Blowfish](https://github.com/nunocoracao/blowfish). So I decided to give it a go.

## What will I do?
1. I'll document my problem-solving and learning journey in a more detailed and organized manner.
2. I aim to write English blog posts to practice my language skills.
3. I will also post some interesting things in my life here.
